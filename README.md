# ML-AirbnbPriceForecasting
I designed a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices using a neural network. 

This project implements a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on a variety of features such as location, property characteristics, amenities, and so on. The model is built using a neural network architecture and optimized for regression tasks.

Key features of the project include:
Neural Network Architecture: A multi-layered sequential model built with Keras for accurate price prediction.
Feature Engineering: Preprocessing of input features such as room type, neighborhood, availability, and more.
Model Evaluation: Performance measured using cross-validation, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Scalability: The model can be adapted to other cities or datasets with minimal changes.
Tools & Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
